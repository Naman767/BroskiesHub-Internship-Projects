This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my BroskiesHub Internship. The internship provided me with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in software development, improve my coding skills, and work on practical implementations of concepts learned in academics. Developed projects focusing on Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JDBC, JPA, and web technologies. Gained exposure to real-world problem solving through structured tasks and mini-projects. Strengthened understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management, and Web Development. Improved Git/GitHub version control workflow by managing projects, commits, and collaboration.
